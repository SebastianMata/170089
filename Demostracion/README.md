# Demostracion: Program Description
Perl Program to Illustrate Different Set Operations

## Boolean Values
The following declaration represents the 2 boolean possibles values (TRUTH=1,FALSE=0) for the operations (AND, OR, NOT, ^) 
```perl
my @booleans=qw(0 1); 
```
## AND Truth table
The AND gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) only if all its inputs are high.  A dot (.) is used to show the AND operation i.e. A.B.  Bear in mind that this dot is sometimes omitted i.e. AB

A | B | A and B 
--- | --- | --- 
| 0 | 0 | 0 
| 0 | 1 | 0
